# Scrabble-Trainer
Scrabble Word Knowledge Trainer: An interactive tool powered by the Gemini API that synthesizes realistic, novel words. Use it to test and train your Scrabble vocabulary by classifying whether each word is real or fake (AI generated)

**USES COLLINS DICTIONARY FOR THE BASE WORDS (I.E, INTERNATIONAL PLAY)**

**ADDITIONALLY, SOME REAL WORDS MAY BE GENERATED BY AI DUE TO THE AI LACKING LAST LAYER FILTERS, I COULD IMPLEMENT A LAST LAYER FILTER FOR THE AI-GENERATED WORDS USING ALL_REAL_WORD.TXT, BUT IT IS NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.**

**THIS TOOL IS 98% PERFECT ONLY**
